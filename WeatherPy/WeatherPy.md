# WeatherPy - Analyzing Global Weather Trends

For this project, we will analyze global cities using data pulled from OpenWeatherMap.org:

The output is to indicate:
* City
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Maximum Temperature
* Cloudiness
* Windspeed
* % Overall Passing

The data then looks at each of the parameters for trends.
The data then presents based on hemisphere.

# VacationPy - Finding my ideal vacation cities and a local hotel

For this project, we will determine which cities have warmer temperatures using data pulled from OpenWeatherMap.org that has been put into a .csv

The output will be mapped via hvplot to a global map.
For each city whose Max Temperature matches my ideal (24 - 27 degrees celcius), find an appropriate hotel
Then the hotel and the country are added to the hover tile on the map.
